ok bro

uhhhh screen isnt diffing correctly i just found out so i guess we should just commit suicide? idfk man
make sure you're comparing everthing correctly

ok screen diffs correctly now but our command shit needs completely rewritten because you can't have a command mode and any other mode at the same time

struct State {
	pub command_mode: bool,
}
