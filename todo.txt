fix the commander and implement some real parsing stuff

the biggest issue is the parsing! this is failing and returning defualt entry:

let entry_meta = self.master_index.entries.get(i as usize).unwrap();
let entry = self
    .entries_map
    .get(&entry_meta.id)
    .unwrap_or(&default_entry); // failing here

so the master index is being updated properly theoretically
because we can lookup the entrymeta in the master index
and debug print it. but the number of loaded entries for 
some stupid fucking reason is 1 less than the num of
entrymeta instances in the master index even though the 
entrymeta should always point to a valid entry

WAIT BREAKTHROUGH! ITS BECAUSE WHEN WE BATCH WRITE

yep fixed it
